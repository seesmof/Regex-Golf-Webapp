## About

This repository contains a multi-level game of _Regex Golf_ where on each level you are given some text and you need to write a matching regular expression pattern to match that text. As you progress further into the game, the levels are becoming increasingly harder. Made with React, TailwindCSS and Vite. Fully functional, fully responsive.
